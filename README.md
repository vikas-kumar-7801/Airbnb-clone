#Airbnb Clone


Leveraging the MERN stack, I contributed to the development of an innovative Airbnb clone.

Integrating unique features such as real-time chat, advanced booking algorithms, and a dynamic pricing model.

My role encompassed building RESTful APIs. This project not only honed my full-stack development skills but also underscored my ability to drive product innovation in a collaborative team environment.
